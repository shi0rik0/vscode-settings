## Extensions

### ms-python.python

It is an official extension from Microsoft. It provides code autocomplete, static checking and debugging capabilities.

This extension uses `pyright` for static type checking. It has three levels of strictness: "basic", "standard" and "strict". I prefer to use the moderate "standard" mode.

### eeyore.yapf

It enables VSCode to format the code using `yapf`. It is packaged with `yapf` so you don't need to install it separately. The default settings of `yapf` comply with the PEP8 standard.
